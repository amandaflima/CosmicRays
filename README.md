# CosmicRays
Scientific initiation research presented at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC) on the propagation of cosmic rays in galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields.

The final report is in the file Scientific_Initiation_Research.pdf and the poster presentation is on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCQSZpCZoPQ


This code simulates the propagation of the trajectory of cosmic rays in the magnetic field in different configurations of magnetic fields: uniform, variable and dipole, in the non-relativistic and relativistic cases.

To plot the graph of the trajectory of the particle, the file plot2.cpp is used and to plot the graphs of period and Radius of Larmor, the file graph_from_data.cpp is used, all of which must be executed in the root software (https://root.cern/).
